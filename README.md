# TransNSCLC

Abstract 
Background: Early response assessment in advanced non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with chemo-immunotherapy remains challenging. Conventional RECIST-based evaluation relies on uni-dimensional measurements from selected slices and may inadequately capture spatially heterogeneous tumor remodeling reflected by treatment-associated CT delta changes.

Purpose: To determine whether joint modeling of temporal CT delta changes and inter-slice spatial coherence improves discrimination and risk stratification in patients with advanced NSCLC receiving chemo-immunotherapy.

Materials and Methods: This retrospective multicenter study included 547 patients with advanced NSCLC who underwent paired baseline and on-treatment contrast-enhanced CT. Among them, 434 patients received chemo-immunotherapy, including 205 patients used for model development (training and internal validation) and 210 patients from an independent external cohort for testing. A chemotherapy-only cohort (n = 132) was analyzed for treatment-specific sensitivity assessment. Treatment-associated CT delta changes were modeled using a deep learning framework that incorporated spatial information across anatomically ordered axial slices. Model performance was compared with delta radiomics, clinical models, ensemble fusion, and multi-instance learning. Discrimination, calibration, decision curve analysis, and survival stratification were evaluated.

Results: At the slice level, deep learning models demonstrated stable but limited discrimination (external test AUC, 0.734). At the patient level, explicit modeling of inter-slice spatial coherence substantially improved performance. In the independent external test cohort, the Transformer-based model achieved an AUC of 0.866, outperforming delta radiomics (0.790), ensemble fusion (0.814), and multi-instance learning (0.748). Performance was attenuated in the chemotherapy-only cohort (AUC, 0.705). A Combined model integrating deep learning features, delta radiomics, and clinical variables achieved the highest performance (external test AUC, 0.901), demonstrated good calibration, higher net clinical benefit on decision curve analysis, and enabled significant stratification of overall and progression-free survival in chemo-immunotherapy–treated patients (log-rank p < 0.05).

Conclusion: Spatial patterns of treatment-associated CT delta changes provide clinically meaningful information beyond conventional delta radiomics. Joint modeling of temporal changes and inter-slice spatial coherence enables improved discrimination and risk stratification in advanced NSCLC receiving chemo-immunotherapy.
